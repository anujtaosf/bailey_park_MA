        <h2>Evaluated Concepts</h2>
        <p>
          Our team evaluated seven potential use cases for the Shady Grove
          Church property, each addressing different community needs and
          priorities identified through our market analysis and community
          engagement:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Concept A: Space for Small Private Businesses</li>
          <li>Concept B: Food Bank and/or Grocery Store</li>
          <li>Concept C: Preserve Sanctuary Space (Keep it a Church)</li>
          <li>Concept D: Community Center</li>
          <li>Concept E: Rental Space (Concerts, Events, Meetings)</li>
          <li>Concept F: Educational Space (Workshops and Youth Programs)</li>
          <li>Concept G: Affordable Housing</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Concept A: Space for Small Private Businesses</h3>
        <p>
          Turning the church into a space where multiple small businesses can
          set up offices or stores would be a way to promote local
          entrepreneurship within Bailey Park, while increasing the number of
          retail stores and shopping experiences residents can have. A few
          community members responded to our survey indicating that more small
          businesses as well as more arts/culture spaces were one of their
          priorities for Bailey Park, and these small business spaces would
          serve that purpose. It would also be a good way to utilize the
          property in an income generating way, as rent payments from the small
          businesses could quickly help pay portions of the renovation costs.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Features:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>The renovated kitchen for a food-based business</li>
          <li>Functional restrooms for a pleasant shopping experience</li>
          <li>Dividers between businesses for separation</li>
          <li>
            The upstairs office can easily accommodate 1-2 tenants looking for a
            rental office space
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          However, upon our site visit to McDougall Hunt, we identified a
          similarly purposed larger space at 1948 Division St which already
          houses a few small businesses including a coffee shop, runners gear
          shop, artisan jewelry store, and more. Upon talking to some staff at
          the buildings, they also shared that there are more currently vacant
          spots for businesses at 1948 Division St. As the current business
          complex is still not yet full, adding an additional space for small
          businesses may not be the most pressing community need at the moment.
          It may be more useful for the Shady Grove Church to be utilized for
          another purpose now, and a future church/property to be utilized for
          small business spaces in the future if needed.
        </p>

        <h3>Concept B: Food Bank and/or Grocery Store</h3>
        <p>
          <em>
            For clarity, there is the potential to utilize the property as both
            a small food pantry and grocery store via the separation of the 2
            floors (floor with pews becomes small grocery store, floor with
            kitchen and tables becomes small food pantry with hot meals).
            However, there is also the potential to select only one of these use
            cases. Selecting both may lead to some issues like the
            underutilization of the grocery store (if there is a free of charge
            food pantry right below, less people will buy groceries even if they
            may be able to afford them. This could incite the issue of deciding
            who is eligible to shop at the food pantry and who is not). For the
            purpose of this analysis though, we will explore both the food
            pantry and grocery store ideas.
          </em>
        </p>
        <p>
          Turning the church into a grocery store and/or a food pantry would
          directly support the "Bailey Park Connections: Food, Care & Check-Ins"
          Initiative by providing a space for residents to either purchase
          healthy produce, or receive food via a food bank. Bailey Park could
          partner with vendors that sell locally grown produce to support local
          entrepreneurship as well. A few residents in our survey indicated that
          their top priority for the neighborhood was more affordable groceries,
          and this use case would directly support this priority. This use case
          also has the potential to receive grant funding, as there are various
          grant programs that fund the creation and sustaining of food pantries
          (e.g., Loaves and Fishes SW Detroit Grant and United Dairy Industry of
          Michigan Food Pantry Grant Program).
        </p>

          <strong>Pantry Use Case Features:</strong>
        </p>

            be sold in-store (slotting fees are common in grocery stores)
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Concept C: Preserve Sanctuary Space/Keep Site as a Church</h3>
        <p>
          Renovating the former Shady Grove site as an active church honors both
          the historic character of the building and the expressed desires of
          McDougall-Hunt residents. In a neighborhood with a tight-knit, older
          population that is deeply invested in the area's future, maintaining
          the building's original religious purpose shows respect for community
          identity and avoids the potential backlash that could arise from
          converting a sacred space into a completely different use. Restoring
          the sanctuary, stained glass, and chapel elements would preserve an
          important neighborhood landmark while bringing it back into functional
          condition. At the same time, the site could be strategically
          positioned as a shared worship space for multiple congregations that
          are currently struggling with low attendance and the financial burden
          of independent facilities. By offering Shady Grove as a renovated,
          cost-effective home or secondary location for these churches, the
          project could support spiritual life, foster collaboration among faith
          communities, and ensure that an important historic structure remains
          active, visible, and valued in the heart of McDougall-Hunt.
        </p>
        <p>
          To note, this concept can easily fit into a hybrid approach in which
          the full site is renovated, with the main (sanctuary) level preserved
          for the main use of worship while the other levels are adapted for
          complementary uses such as rental space, community gathering areas, or
          small business incubator space (i.e. the alternate concepts
          highlighted in this document). In addition, on days the sanctuary
          space is not being utilized for worship, it can also be utilized for
          other purposes such as meetings, concerts, theater productions, and
          youth camp activities. This would allow the organization to honor the
          building's historic and spiritual role while also advancing broader
          neighborhood goals identified elsewhere in this report, diversifying
          revenue streams, and increasing the overall impact of the site for
          McDougall-Hunt residents.
        </p>

        <h3>Concept D: Community Center</h3>
        <p>
          Turning the church into a community center would provide a space for
          community members to come together, creating more unity throughout
          McDougall-Hunt. The need for a community center came directly from
          resident feedback through surveys and one-on-one conversations during
          the McDougall-Hunt community meeting. Overall, the need for a
          community center was ranked higher than any other use case, with many
          community members expressing concerns for their well-being and the
          well-being of younger generations. One member directly conveyed to us
          that adolescents needed a place to go where they wouldn't get in
          trouble. His idea included foosball tables and other games that could
          be used as a place for kids to hang out after school. During the
          community meeting, we noticed that it was held in a gym where people
          sat in plastic chairs and tables that needed to be set up and taken
          down every meeting. The church would act as a central hub for the
          neighborhood and a permanent meeting place for community meetings.
          People can use this space to discuss prevalent community issues and
          work together to improve the neighborhood. It could also be used to
          host large gatherings and events for all age groups that bring
          everyone together.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Features:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Bulletin board to post upcoming events</li>
          <li>A news stand for folks to take flyers/brochures</li>
          <li>
            Tables and chairs for people to play games, hang out, eat food, etc.
          </li>
          <li>Communal games</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>
          Concept E: Rental Space/Lease (Multi-Function: Concerts, Performances,
          Events, Meetings)
        </h3>
        <p>
          Renovating the Shady Grove site into leasable space would transform
          the building into a flexible revenue-generating asset for Bailey Park
          Neighborhood Development Corporation while directly addressing gaps in
          the local real estate market. With only four lease spaces currently
          available within McDougall-Hunt area and only a handful more in nearby
          areas such as Eastern Market (see Market Analysis for additional
          details), the site could offer much-needed commercial and community
          space at market-aligned rates (approximately $12-$22 per square foot
          per year). The building could be configured as a single large tenant
          space or subdivided into multiple smaller units to accommodate a mix
          of neighborhood-serving uses—such as small businesses, professional
          services, health or social services, food vendors, or educational/arts
          organizations—that residents can walk to for everyday needs,
          reinforcing the client's stated goal of improving walkability and
          local access. In addition, portions of the building could be designed
          as flexible event, performance, or meeting space that can be rented
          for concerts, community gatherings, and private events, providing both
          a cultural hub for the neighborhood and an additional, steady income
          stream that Bailey Park Neighborhood Development Corporation can
          reinvest into broader community development efforts.
        </p>

        <h3>
          Concept F: Educational Space (Workshops for Youth and Community)
        </h3>
        <p>
          Turning the Shady Grove Church into an education center can improve
          youth development and learning opportunities in the McDougall-Hunt
          community. Based on feedback from residents at community meetings,
          some people are worried about the lack of positive activity spaces for
          teenagers after school. As one community member pointed out in Concept
          D, "teenagers need a place where they won't get in trouble," a space
          where they can safely hang out and participate in meaningful
          activities after school. Research shows that high-quality youth
          development programs can significantly improve teenagers' important
          skills. Programs can help teenagers develop the skills they need to
          succeed in school, careers, and life. However, there are common
          obstacles to creating these spaces. According to a survey by
          BridgeDetroit, the two main factors that stop children from joining
          skill-training programs are cost and transportation. If these barriers
          are removed, more than half would participate. By creating a walkable,
          low-cost educational space within the McDougall-Hunt community, Shady
          Grove Church can directly remove these participation barriers. Success
          stories like the Detroit Food Academy show how community education
          programs can provide practical skill training while promoting local
          entrepreneurship and economic empowerment.
        </p>
        <p>
          By turning the church into a multi-generational learning center,
          Bailey Park can partner with local schools, libraries, non-profit
          organizations (like Brilliant Detroit), and community volunteers to
          offer a series of free or low-cost programs that directly improve
          residents' quality of life and economic opportunities. This space will
          serve as a tool for community empowerment, helping teenagers and
          residents of all ages gain valuable knowledge and resources.

            Provides practical life skills training to help teenagers and people
            of other ages gain practical skills needed to succeed in the modern

            families
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <strong>Sustainability:</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          While most programs should be free or low-cost, the educational space
          can still generate some income to support its operations through:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Applying for state and federal grants for youth development and
            adult education
          </li>
          <li>Partnering with foundations to obtain program funding</li>
          <li>Charging nominal fees for families who can afford it</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Concept G: Affordable Housing</h3>
        <p>
          Redeveloping the Shady Grove Church property into affordable housing
          would provide homes to residents in the McDougal-Hunt community area,
          while also generating income through rent to cover costs for the
          renovation of the property and for the mortgage. Affordable housing
          was the second highest polling priority in the community with thirty
          percent of the polled McDougal-Hunt residents indicating it was their
          priority. On top of that, there is limited affordable housing in the
          McDougal-Hunt area, and with the median McDougal-Hunt income being
          $36,078, there is a clear market demand for affordable housing.
        </p>
        <p>
          This option could bring new residents into the McDougal-Hunt neighborhood
          while also providing stable, affordable homes for current residents.
          With roughly 25,000 square feet of land available across the church
          parcel and adjacent lots, a sufficient number of housing units could
          feasibly be developed to achieve financial sustainability with rents
          set below current market levels.

        <h3>Explanation of Decision Matrix and Criteria</h3>
        <p>
          The Pugh Matrix evaluates each concept across nine weighted criteria.
          Each criterion uses a scoring system where 1 indicates a positive
          impact, 0 indicates no impact, and -1 indicates a negative impact. The
          criteria were chosen based on a combination of factors: market
          research, the McDougall-Hunt Sustainable Redevelopment Plan, and our
          consultant visit to the McDougall-Hunt Neighborhood monthly meeting.

        <h2>Final Decision and Analysis</h2>
        <p>
          Based on our decision matrix (Figure 1), the community center received
          the highest overall score out of all the proposed concepts. In the
          Pugh Matrix, it scored especially well in categories with high
          weights, such as resident support, community vision alignment, and
          market demand. Both our market analysis and the feedback we gathered
          from residents show that there is a strong need for a community center
          in the neighborhood. McDougall-Hunt is a growing and active community
          where many residents are deeply involved and invested in improving the
          area. The residents we spoke with emphasized the importance of having
          a central gathering hub where people can meet, hold events, and access
          resources.
        </p>
        <p>
          The second highest scoring concept was an education and training
          center. The Pugh Matrix shows that this option performed well in
          categories related to job creation and market demand. Community
          members expressed a desire for more educational opportunities, skills
          workshops, and workforce training.
        </p>
        <p>
          The third and fourth highest scoring concepts were converting Shady
          Grove Church into either a grocery store or a space for small
          businesses. These scored moderately well in revenue potential and job
          creation. They also support the goal of bringing more daily
          necessities and economic activity into the neighborhood. These options
          would create a consistent revenue stream that could help offset
          property taxes and maintenance costs.
        </p>
        <p>
          After reviewing the results across all criteria, our team believes
          that transforming the church into a multi-functional community center
          aligns best with the needs and priorities of the community. The
          community center not only achieved the highest overall score in the
          Pugh Matrix, but provides a much needed resource for McDougall-Hunt.
        </p>

        <h3>Multi-Functional Community Center Approach</h3>
        <p>
          While the primary function of the community center would be to serve
          as a central hub for gatherings and events, the space could also
          incorporate many of the strengths found in the other high scoring
          concepts. For example, since education and training ranked second, the
          center could host regular workshops, classes, tutoring sessions, and
          afterschool programs for students. This would meet the community's
          interest in more accessible learning opportunities. In addition,
          bringing small businesses into the space would encourage local
          business development and job creation. Coffee shops, bakeries, craft
          vendors, or pop up retail could rotate through designated areas of the
          building. This would increase foot traffic, create economic activity,
          and help generate revenue to support the center's operating costs and
          property taxes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Overall, a community center is the strongest and most flexible option.
          It not only satisfies the highest weighted community priorities but
          also allows for the integration of educational workshops and small
          business activity. By combining these concepts, the site can become a
          vibrant and sustainable resource that supports McDougall-Hunt's long
          term mission.
